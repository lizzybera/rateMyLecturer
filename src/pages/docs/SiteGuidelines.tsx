Rate My Lecturers has a team of moderators who read every rating submitted. We have defined site guidelines to help reinforce our mission and most importantly to ensure our decisions around moderation are 100% consistent, regardless of student or professor. Our moderators are experts on our guidelines and will remove any comment that doesn’t comply.             
                <div className='mt-4'>
                Did we miss something? If you feel an inappropriate comment should be removed from the site, we want to know. You can flag a comment for re-review and it will immediately be escalated to our moderators. Moderators will determine whether to remove the rating permanently or restore it to the website. Our moderators will never edit a rating to make it comply or remove a rating simply because it is a low score or negative review.

Be honest in your reviews. You want to be able to trust these reviews when evaluating your course options, so we ask that to contribute in the same spirit.      
                <div className='mt-3'>
                When you are reviewing a class and/or Professor/Lecturer, it’s often helpful to provide both pros and cons. This leads to much more credible and constructive feedback for your peers.
                </div>
                <div className='mt-3'>
                Reviews should focus specifically on the course and your learning experience. Do not comment on a Professor/Lecturer’s appearance, dress, age, gender or race.
                </div>
                <div className='mt-3'>
                Avoid hearsay. We want you to share your individual experience and what you took away from the course. Don’t speak on behalf of another, encourage others to submit their own reviews.
                </div>
                <div className='mt-3'>
                This is not a forum for debate. Reviews that specifically reference another review will be removed. If you do not agree with someone’s individual experience, we encourage you to share your own.
                </div>
                <div className='mt-3'>
                We understand that not all teachers are the perfect match for each individual learning style. Tell us how the course or Professor/Lecturer wasn’t the best for you in a way that helps others make their own decision.
                </div>
                <div className='mt-3'>
                Reviews fuelled by anger do not reflect well on the author and can be removed for violations such as profanity. Take a minute to step back and make sure your review will genuinely help others understand your experience.

                We only allow one student to review a Professor/Lecturer one time per course. Spamming or dogpiling an account will lead to comment removal and the account being temporarily locked on the site.
